# DiTree

[project page](https://sites.google.com/view/ditree/home) , [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001)

Official implementation of the paper "Train Once Plan Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees" [CoRL 25]

This repository contains the code and experiment setup for  **Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees** . It includes training configuration, experiment execution scripts, and pretrained model checkpoints.

The associated car dataset and model weights are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k8Btmcfqqa1YHKoZ8GNUEc8YKzK4SmWS?usp=drive_link).

## 📦 Installation

We recommend creating a Python virtual environment before installing dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yanivhass/ditree.git
cd ditree
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

3. **Install PyTorch**
   Visit [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the correct installation command for your system (CPU or GPU).
   Example (CUDA 11.8):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

4. **Install other dependencies**
We provide here a minimal list of depencencies for running the car experiments. Other functionalities might require additional installation (e.g. Mujoco's Ant requiring Mujoco). 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
